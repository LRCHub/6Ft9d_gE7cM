Oooh
Woke up this morning
Opened up my curtains
What do I see
What a lovely day
No sign of the clouds
Sunshine and crown
Don't wanna go to work
Cos I got to play
And head for the beach
Call all my peeps
Do a whole lot of nothing all day long
I don't care about the 9-5
Right here's where I belong

And I gotta funny feeling that
Things are gonna go my way
Whoa

Ain't gonna be no clouds
Hanging over my head no more
All I can see is sunshine
There's one thing I know for sure
That
No way I'm holding onto yesterday
No more
Living for today
I don't care 'bout tomorrow

There was a time
When you always would deny
You were sly
You were hiding things from me
Leaving every lie
Never listened to my own mind
Without you here
I've opened my eyes
Now I really see
The way is clear
All that matters is right here, right now
Live my life the way I wanna be
My life's ahead of me
Now I ain't gonna worry about the time

This day is mine
Whoa Whoa Whoa
Ain't gonna be no clouds

All I can see is sunshine
Hanging over my head no more
There's one thing I know for sure
That
No way I'm holding onto yesterday
No more
Living for today
I don't care 'bout tomorrow

Ain't gonna be no clouds
Hanging over my head no more (be no clouds)
All I can see is sunshine
There's one thing I know for sure
That
No way I'm holding onto yesterday (all I see is sunshine)
No more
Living for today
I don't care 'bout tomorrow

[Rap]
Ain't gonna be no clouds
I got myself a positive mentality
I'm Miss Congeniality
When You were in my life, I never got the chance to do
Thinking about the things that I'd like to do
You make a tipply
It was hard for me to see I only needed me
Make me think that I couln't be what I wanted to be
But now that I'm free I realised
That my life is mine
This is my own time

Oooooh
Yeah Yeah
Oooooh

(Don't Care)
Ain't gonna be no clouds
Hanging over my head no more (gon' be no clouds)
All I can see is sunshine
There's one thing I know for sure
That
No way I'm holding onto yesterday (the way I'm holding on)
No more
Living for today
I don't care 'bout tomorrow (Never No More)

Hanging over my head no more (no clouds)
Ain't gonna be no clouds
All I can see is sunshine (no clouds)
There's one thing I know for sure (I know for sure)
That
No way I'm holding onto yesterday (I'm holding onto yesterday)
No more
Living for today
I don't care 'bout tomorrow
(Don't Care)

Ain't gonna be no clouds
Hanging over my head no more (Oh)
All I can see is sunshine
There's one thing I know for sure
That
No way I'm holding onto yesterday
No more (No More)
Living for today
I don't care 'bout tomorrow
Ain't gonna be no clouds

Hanging over my head no more
All I can see is sunshine
That
There's one thing I know for sure
No way I'm holding onto yesterday
No more
Living for today
I don't care 'bout tomorrow
